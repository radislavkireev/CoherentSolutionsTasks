Task 2. The 10-digit ISBN is a numeric code that uniquely identifies a book. It has the
following form: d1d2d3d4d5d6d7d8d9d10.. Digit d10 is a control one. It is calculated
according to the condition that the expression

10d1 + 9d2 + 8d3+.. .+ 1d10

(the sum of the products of code elements by the weight of their positions) must be a
multiple of 11. Create a program that prompts the user for a 9 character-digit string (the
first nine digits of the ISBN), calculates the check digit, and prints the resulting ISBN. Do
not check the correctness of the user's input - assume that the user does not make
mistakes when entering.
Note 1: the check "digit" can be equal to 10. In this case, the symbol X is used to denote it.
