Task 3. The application asks the user for the number of elements in a numeric array (at
least two), and then in a loop -the elements themselves (of int type). After entering the
elements, the application prints out the original array and outputs the sum of the array
elements located between the smallest element in the array (the leftmost element if there
are several) and the largest element (the rightmost element if there are several). Develop
a console application that implements the specified functionality.
Example: array [1, 3, 5, 1, 0, 3, 0, 1]. The sum of the required elements = 5 + 1 + 0 = 6.
Note 1: the correctness of the length of the array can be left unchecked.
