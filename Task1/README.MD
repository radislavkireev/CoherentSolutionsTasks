Task 1. Create a console application, whichasks the user for two integers a and b (assume
that the user enters integers without errors). The application then prints out all integers
in the range from a (inclusive) to b (inclusive) that have exactly two 2's in their ternary
number system (0, 1, 2) representation. Develop a console application that implements
the specified functionality.
Note: to convert a string s to an int value, use the int.Parse(s) method.
